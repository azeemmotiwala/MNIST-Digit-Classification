MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This is the very beginning project of mine in Neural Networks.
This project is based on classifying hand written digits which
are of resolution 28*28 using a Dense Neural Network Model. 

Libraries Used
1) Tensorflow
2) Keras
3) Numpy
4) Matplotlib
5) cv2
6) os

In this project I have used the MNIST Dataset of handwritten digits
which is available on the interent. This Dataset can be directly used 
with the help of tensorflow libraries and hence no extra csv file was 
needed. I haved made 3 layers of neural network. The first and the
second layer containing 128 neurons and its activation function as ReLu.
The third layer consists of 10 neurons and its activation function as
softmax. I have used the Adam optimiser for optimising the learning algo-
rithm. Finally I used cv2 and os library to test the new set of handwritten
digits. I was able to get an accuracy of 97% on the Test data.
